DFT-AL-framework-Biomass-Conversion

This Repository contains the Juypter Notebooks and Spreadsheet developed for the article "Transformative Strategies for Bimetallic Catalyst Screening in Biomass Conversion Through Active Learning and DFT"

Notebooks for model interpretation

The main notebooks used for machine learning models are "Model training prediction and feature importance analysis. ipynb" ,"SR-fitness.ipynb"and  "GpLearn screen.ipynb". These notebooks are used to generate the predictions ï¼Œ PDP plots and SHAP plots. The "Model training prediction and feature importance analysis. ipynb" Notebook contains codes to plot the trajectory plots.

Dataset: SpreadSheets and CSV files

The spreadsheets for the Final Data are presents in both .xlsx and .csv formats.
