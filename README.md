This Repository contains the Juypter Notebooks and Spreadsheet developed for the article "Transformative Strategies for Bimetallic Catalyst Screening in Biomass Conversion Through Active Learning and DFT"

# Dataset: SpreadSheets and CSV files

The spreadsheets for the Final Data are presents in both .xlsx and .csv formats.

# Notebooks for model interpretation

In the research framework for predicting carbon-oxygen bond cleavage energy barriers and catalyst surface energies, the core machine learning models in both frameworks are implemented through the primary notebook titled "Model training prediction and feature importance analysis.ipynb","Symbol conversion.ipynb"and "Symbol conversion screen.ipynb". Within this notebook, "Symbol conversion.ipynb" is used for fitting feature variables, "Symbol conversion screen. ipynb" is responsible for transforming unlabeled data (the prediction set) into feature variables of the same dimensionality as the symbolic data, and "Model training prediction and feature importance analysis. ipynb" is utilized for model training and prediction.   Additionally, "Model training prediction and feature importance analysis. ipynb" integrates code for generating visualizations such as Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), SHAP analysis, and permutation importance analysis trajectory plots, providing comprehensive support for model interpretation and visualization.
